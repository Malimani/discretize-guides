# Gearing up for the endgame

So you made it to level 80 and can't wait to start with endgame content. You took a look at different websites for optimised builds, traits and encounter guides and now you are wondering how to get the gear to match. Maybe a bit anxious about wasting ressources, at least we all were when we started. This guide will show you all the different ways to get gear in Guild Wars 2, some obvious, some less known.

## On rarity

Gear comes in different rarities. Rarity affects the amount of stats on any gearable item and the [Weapon Strength](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Weapon_Strength) of weapons. We will be talking mostly about Exotic (e.g.<Item name="Devona's Chestguard"/>) and Ascended (e.g.<Item name="Zojja's Breastplate"/>) rarity in this guide, whith a nod or two towards Legendary (e.g.<Item name="Perfected Envoy Jerkin"/>) rarity. 

Exotic Items are very affordable and already offer an amount of stats that allows a skilled player to outperform others that might have Ascended gear, but are less secure in how to get the best out of their builds and encounters. This makes Exotic the perfect starter gear for most endgame endeavours.

Ascended Items have the highest stats in the game. They offer 6% more stats than Exotic Items and are the foundation to get the most out of a build. Starting at fractal level 20, players need to deal with <Effect name="Agony"/> which requires increasing amounts of <Attribute name="Agony Resistance"/>. Ascended Items have Infusion Slots which are used to slot Infusions which give <Attribute name="Agony Resistance"/> (e.g. <Item name="+9 Agony Infusion"/>). If you want to delve deeper into fractals and reach the higher tiers, you will need to get a nearly full set of ascended gear.

Legendary items offer the same stats as Ascended Items. They also have the necessary infusion slots for <Attribute name="Agony Resistance"/>. Contrary to Exotic and Ascended items, you can freely change the stat combination of Legendary items whenever you want. They also unlock for your whole account and can be worn by all eligible characters in all equipment tabs simultaneously with different stats and skins. They are very expensive and one of the long term goals Guild Wars 2 has to offer.

## Not all stat combinations are equal

Guild Wars 2 offers many different [Stat Combinations](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Attribute_combinations), of which only a few are used for pve builds. The stat combinations commonly used are:

| Name            | Stats  | Commentary |
| --------------- | -------| ---------------------------------------------- |
| Assassin        | Ferocity Precision Power  | to adjust power build for [Internal Link](/crit-cap) |
| Berserker       | Ferocity Precision Power  | |
| Celestial       | Cell 4 | |
| Diviner         | Cell 4 |
| Seraph          | Cell 4 |
| Sinister        | Cell 4 |
| Viper           | Cell 4 |

## Gearing up for the endgame

So you made it to level 80 and can't wait to start with endgame content. You took a look at different websites for optimised builds, traits and encounter guides and now you are wondering how to get the gear to match. Maybe a bit anxious about wasting ressources, at least we all were when we started. This guide will show you all the different ways to get gear in Guild Wars 2, some obvious, some less known.

## On rarity

Gear comes in different rarities. Rarity affects the amount of stats on any gearable item and the [Weapon Strength](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Weapon_Strength) of weapons. We will be talking mostly about Exotic (e.g.<Item name="Devona's Chestguard"/>) and Ascended (e.g.<Item name="Zojja's Breastplate"/>) rarity in this guide, whith a nod or two towards Legendary (e.g.<Item name="Perfected Envoy Jerkin"/>) rarity.
